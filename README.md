# Project Title

## Description
This project contains Discord bot scripts designed to perform various functions within a Discord server. These include sending messages, banning users, and general interactions.

## Prerequisites
Before running the scripts, you need to have Python installed along with the `discord` Python package. You will also need a Discord bot token. Follow these steps:

1. Install Python (3.7 or later is recommended).
2. Install the `discord.py` library using pip:

   ```
   pip install discord.py
   ```

3. Obtain a bot token from Discord Developer Portal and replace `'your_bot_token'` in the scripts with your actual bot token.

## Files
- **another (1).py**: Handles sending scheduled messages and logs bot readiness.
- **ban.py**: Provides commands to ban and kick users from a server.
- **hello.py**: General interaction commands for greeting and helping users.

## Setup
To run these scripts:
1. Ensure you have followed the prerequisites mentioned above.
2. Replace the placeholder bot token in each script with your actual bot token from the Discord Developer Portal.

## Running the Scripts
To run each script, use the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
```
python <filename>
```
Replace `<filename>` with the name of the script you want to run (`another (1).py`, `ban.py`, `hello.py`).

## Additional Notes
- **another (1).py**: This script sends messages every 1 minute. Modify the `channel.send` method to change the message content or interval.
- **ban.py**: This script allows moderators to ban or kick users. Ensure the bot has the appropriate permissions on your server.
- **hello.py**: Modify message handlers in this script based on desired interactions.
